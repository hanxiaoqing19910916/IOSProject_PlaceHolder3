The NSWindow class defines objects that manage and coordinate the windows an application displays on the screen. A single NSWindow object corresponds to at most one onscreen window. The two principal functions of an NSWindow object are to provide an area in which NSView objects can be placed and to accept and distribute, to the appropriate views, events the user instigates through actions with the mouse and keyboard. Note that the term window sometimes refers to the Application Kit object and sometimes to the window server’s display device; which meaning is intended is made clear in context. AppKit also defines an abstract subclass of NSWindow—NSPanel—that adds behavior more appropriate for auxiliary windows.
